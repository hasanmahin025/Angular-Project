      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p><strong>C Programming was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories.</strong></p>
      <p>
        It was created to solve the limitations of earlier programming languages. Initially, C was designed for
        developing the UNIX operating system. It drew concepts from languages like <code>B</code> and <code>BCPL</code>,
        becoming the foundation of many modern programming languages today.
